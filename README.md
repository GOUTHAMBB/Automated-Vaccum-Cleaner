# Automatic Vacuum Cleaner

## Overview
The Automatic Vacuum Cleaner is a project aimed at automating the process of cleaning floors using robotics and sensors. This project utilizes an Arduino Uno microcontroller along with various electronic components to create a fully automated vacuum cleaner.

## Features
- **Start-up Sequence:** The vacuum cleaner initializes upon power-on and performs self-checks.
- **Battery Status Check:** It checks the battery status before starting the cleaning process.
- **Cleaning Functionality:** Upon confirming sufficient power, the vacuum cleaner starts cleaning by navigating the environment.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Ultrasonic sensors assist the vacuum cleaner in detecting and avoiding obstacles in its path.
- **High-speed Suction:** A high-speed DC motor creates suction to collect dust and debris.

## Components
- Arduino Uno
- Four servo motors
- H-Bridge
- Three ultrasonic sensors
- High-speed DC motor

## Functionality
The Arduino Uno serves as the brain of the vacuum cleaner, coordinating the operation of all components. The servo motors control movement, while the H-Bridge regulates the DC motor's speed for suction. Ultrasonic sensors provide input for obstacle detection, enabling the vacuum cleaner to navigate autonomously.

## Usage
To use the Automatic Vacuum Cleaner:
1. Connect the necessary components as per the circuit diagram.
2. Upload the Arduino sketch to the Arduino Uno.
3. Power on the vacuum cleaner.
4. Follow the instructions for initiating the cleaning process.

## Installation
Ensure you have the Arduino IDE installed on your computer. Download the required libraries for the project and include them in your Arduino sketch.
